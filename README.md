# Invoices

This application allows you to upload your invoice PDF file and corresponding information. You can also fill out recipient information and add additional files.

### Prerequisites

Please make sure you use Ruby 2.3 and NPM 2.15.11 (Node v4.8.2) to avoid any problems during installation.

### Installation

To install and run the project run following commands:
```
# git clone git@github.com:misha-slyusarev/invoices.git
# cd invoices
# bundle
# rspec
# rails s -p 3001
```

React client for the API resides under `client` folder so you should be able to navigate to the folder and invoke these commands:
```
# cd client
# npm install
# npm start
```

Right after the project is compiled you should be redirected to the browser where you can see the application's interface.
